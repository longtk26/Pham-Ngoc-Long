# A Crude Server

## Introduction ðŸ”–
This server is a RESTful API designed to manage product resources efficiently. It supports the fundamental operations:

1. Create: Add new products to the database.
2. Read: Fetch product details or list products with filters.
3. Update: Modify existing product information.
4. Delete: Remove products from the database.
<br/>

The server utilizes PostgreSQL as its database, Prisma ORM for seamless database interaction, and Docker for a streamlined setup.

```
### Step 2: Redirect to problem5 folder using this command

```
### Step 3: Setup .env file
When you are in `Pham-Ngoc-Long/src/problem5`. Create a `.env` file with the content follow in `.ex.env` file

### Step 4: Init environment

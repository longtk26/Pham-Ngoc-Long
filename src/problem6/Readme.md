# Specification for API Service: Scoreboard Management

---

## 1. **Overview**

This module is responsible for managing the scoreboard of users, displaying their scores on the website, and updating the scores when users complete actions that increase their scores. The scoreboard will show the top 10 users' scores in real-time. The API service will handle requests for score updates while ensuring that scores are only modified by legitimate actions.

## 2. **Software Requirements**

1. **Scoreboard Display:**
   - A leaderboard (top 10) will be displayed on the website showing users and their scores.
   - The scores should update in real-time without requiring users to refresh the page.

2. **User Score Updates:**
   - When a user completes an action, their score will increase, and an API call will be made to update the user's score on the server.

3. **Security:**
   - To ensure that scores cannot be maliciously increased, we will use proper authorization mechanisms such as JWT tokens to authenticate API calls and verify the legitimacy of the score update request.
   - If the request is deemed unauthorized, it should be rejected with a proper error response.

4. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - The server will notify all connected clients of any score changes to keep the scoreboard up-to-date in real time.
   - The server will use WebSocket or a similar technology for broadcasting updates to the clients.
